Homebrew BreadBoard Computer (BBC!) - 128

Quick introduction notes on this zip file
-	In the root, I have packaged the as65 assembler by Kingswood Consulting

- 	As per their terms, as65.man is also included which provides useful
	information on usage.

-	bat.bat and nppasm.bat contain scripts to build the binaries
-	nppasm.bat is configures to be executable fron notepad++
	-	The first 'cd' command must be the full path to this root

-	All the folders contain .s and .i assembler files which are processed
-	by as65.exe
-	Exeception is the special folders
	-	bank : Configuration of 4x16KB banks in the ROM
		-	bank*.s include the appropriate assembler files for that banks
		-	extern.mak defines which routines need to be globally available
		-	autogen.s is generated by the build scripts for global routines
		-	The bank*.sym and bank*.lst are generated by as65 assembly
		-	bank.i is the macro used to enable globally accessible
	-	rom : Binaries and final ROM image
		-	bank*.bin is the assembled binary for each 16KB bank
		-	BBC128.ROM is the combined 64KB ROM file for the whole system
		
TODO
-	Proper design description of the hardware and software
-	A manual for the dflat interpeter and inline assembler
